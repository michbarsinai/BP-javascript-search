# BPjs: A Javascript-based Behavioral Programming Library

This repository contains a javascript-based [BP](www.b-prog.org) library. It uses the [Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino) engine, as some of its features require continuations and Rhino seems to be the only one to support it as this point.

This library was originally created my @moshewe.
